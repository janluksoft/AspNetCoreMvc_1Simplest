# ASP.NET Core MVC 1 simplest

This is the simplest ASP.NET Core MVC project that can be. 

![](/Jpg/App_MVC_Level1.png)

The project has one controller, one index.cshtml single page , and css page style. Nothing more. The project has no data base engine or model class. But it works correctly.

There are a lot of examples of Razor-Pages on the internet using the sample page creator. There are a lot of unnecessary files on such a page and a beginner does not know which files are the most important. 
Therefore, this project is created by manually adding only the necessary folders and files.
